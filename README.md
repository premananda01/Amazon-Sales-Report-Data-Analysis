I have undertaken a comprehensive data analytics project focusing on the sales report analysis of one of the greatest e-commerce platforms AMAZON. The primary tools used in this project were Excel and Power BI. Excel was employed for initial data cleaning, organization, and preliminary analysis. This included tasks such as data import, handling missing values, data normalization, and preliminary statistical analysis.

Power BI was then utilized to create an interactive dashboard that provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for exploring Amazon's sales data. The dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of various key performance indicators (KPIs), including sales trends over time, product performance metrics, and regional sales distribution. Users can interact with the dashboard to filter data by different categories, such as product type, time period, and geographic region, enabling a deeper understanding of the sales dynamics.

Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate the power of data analytics in the e-commerce sector. The interactive dashboard not only highlights significant trends and patterns in the sales data but also provides actionable insights that can be leveraged for strategic decision-making. This project showcases my ability to use advanced data analytics tools to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and insights.
